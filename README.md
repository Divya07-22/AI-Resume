# AI Resume Builder

A premium, high-fidelity resume building platform built within the **KodNest Premium Build System**. This project combines a structured engineering Build Track with a high-performance product workspace designed for impact-driven careers.

🚀 **Live Demo**: [https://ai-resume-taupe.vercel.app/](https://ai-resume-taupe.vercel.app/)

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Oxblood Palette**: Minimalist aesthetic using `#8B0000` accents on a `#F7F6F3` background.
- **Typography**: Sophisticated pairing of `'Playfair Display'` (Serif) for headings and `'Inter'` (Sans-serif) for body text.
- **Architecture**: Strict separation of high-integrity resume data and visual presentation templates.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

### 1. Build Track (Project 3 Shell)
An 8-step engineering substrate focused on the design and architecture of the system:
- **Sequential Gating**: Mandatory artifact-driven progression (01–08).
- **Build Panel**: Integrated workspace for Lovable prompt generation.
- **Verification Engine**: Built-in 5-point design quality checklist.
- **Route**: Accessible via `/rb/01-problem`.

### 2. Product Workspace (AI Resume Builder)
A professional-grade builder experience with real-time feedback:

#### **A. Template System**
- **Classic**: Traditional single-column professional layout.
- **Modern**: Bold, accented headers with improved visual hierarchy.
- **Minimal**: Contemporary, simplified structure focusing on pure content.
- *Layouts are switchable instantly without losing content or affecting ATS scores.*

#### **B. Writing Assistant & Bullet Discipline**
- **Inline Guidance**: Real-time tips for every bullet point in Experience and Projects.
- **Action Verb Enforcement**: Encourages strong starts (e.g., *Built, Designed, Optimized*).
- **Measurable Impact**: Flags bullets missing numeric proof (%, X, numbers).

#### **C. ATS Scoring Engine (v1)**
- **Deterministic Scoring**: A 0–100 score based on hard rules for summary length, project volume, skill density, and measurability.
- **Top 3 Improvements**: An actionable panel that identifies the most impactful fixes to boost your score.

#### **D. Technical Features**
- **Autosave Engine**: Instant persistence to `localStorage` (zero data loss on refresh).
- **Live Preview**: Real-time rendering of content with professional typography.
- **Clean Mode**: Pure B&W preview optimized for ATS and high-fidelity PDF output.
