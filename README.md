## 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Oxblood Palette**: Minimalist aesthetic using `#8B0000` accents on a `#F7F6F3` background.
- **Typography**: Sophisticated pairing of `'Playfair Display'` (Serif) for headings and `'Inter'` (Sans-serif) for body text.
- **Geometry**: Strict adherence to an 8px spacing scale (8/16/24/40/64px).
